# Checkout System UI Automation Testing Project

This repository demonstrates the structure and framework of an automated testing project designed for a checkout system. The original project I worked on is proprietary and cannot be shared in its entirety. Therefore, this project serves as a template showcasing the structure, setup, and approach used for automating the testing of a checkout system.

## Project Structure

The project follows a Cucumber-based BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) framework using Selenium WebDriver to automate web interactions and JUnit for managing test execution. 

## Key Features

- **Test Automation**: The project automates key flows within a sample checkout system, simulating real-world scenarios such as login, adding items to cart, navigating the checkout process, and validating transaction summaries.
- **Cucumber BDD**: Uses Cucumber to define test scenarios in natural language, making the tests readable for both technical and non-technical team members.
- **Reusable Components**: Code and configurations are structured to support easy maintenance, scalability, and reusability across different environments and test cases.

## Notes

- **Proprietary Restrictions**: This project is a simplified representation of an automation framework. It omits proprietary data, specific business logic, and other confidential elements from the original project to comply with confidentiality requirements.
- **Sample Links and Data**: The URLs, links, and data in this framework are provided solely as placeholders for demonstration purposes and will not work in a live environment.
- **Environment Configurations**: Sensitive information such as credentials is managed through environment variables to enhance security.
